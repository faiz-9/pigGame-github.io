PIG GAME

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- But wait.. There is a twist in the game, if any of the player rolls two 6 in a row, that player will lose his entire global score and all his score will 
  be 0, also a 1 last and amazing twist is -- suppose any of the player is far away from the other player(winning), and the other player rolls 6 , and if 
  he holds and passes the dice to the player who is winning , then keep in mind that the other player already rolled a 6 and passed it, now...if the player
  who is winning rolls a 6 on his 1st attempt, that player will lose his entire global score..and the turn will be passed as well.... interesting.. right. 
  ENJOY THE GAME
